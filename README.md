# Test Driven Developement Workshop

This is the PHP code base to use when attending my introduction to TDD workshop

## Tasks

### Demo 1 (Stack - Abstract Data Type)

As a group we will implement a String Stack (First In, Last Out - FILO) that will conform to the [Collection Interface](src/Collection.php).

### Task 1 (Queue - Abstract Data Type)

In pairs you will implement a String Queue (First In, First Out - FIFO) that will conform to the [Collection Interface](src/Collection.php).
