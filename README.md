# Test Driven Developement Workshop

This is the PHP code base to use when attending my introduction to TDD workshop

## Tasks

### Task 1 (First Unit tests)

Writing all tests first create an implementation of the [MarkInteger interface](src/Number/MarksInteger.php).

### Task 2 (Refactoring)

Refactor the existing [Calculator](src/Number/Calculator.php) Class without breaking or editing the [tests](test/Number/CalculatorTest.php) that exist for it.

### Tast 3 (Mocking)

TODO
